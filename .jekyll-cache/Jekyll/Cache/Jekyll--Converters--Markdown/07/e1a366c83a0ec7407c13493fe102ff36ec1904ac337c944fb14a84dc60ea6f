<p>I got interested in Your Lie In April because my friend and I were going to watch the show in April 2021, but we didn‚Äôt because his parents are really strict. However, I still wanted to watch Your Lie In April (even though it wasn‚Äôt April), so I decided to watch it by myself. To say the least, it was very very worth it =).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The premise of Your Lie In April is about a piano prodigy in his childhood named Arima Kousei who lost his ability to play the piano after the death of his mother. Then Arima meets a violinist named Kaori and Kaori attempts to aid Arima back on his feet as a pianist</p>

<p>The music is really good overall. Both introductions were really good with the first intro being really iconic, and the second intro being really really good, however, kind of getting overshadowed by the first intro. But regardless, the 2nd intro is really really good too. In the 2nd intro, I‚Äôm kind of obsessed about how Kaori says ‚Äúsymphony‚Äù. There‚Äôs very beautiful music throughout the anime, and it is one of my favourite OST‚Äôs in anime of all time with my favourite song being ‚ÄúFriend A‚Äù. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ohDQ-umHM">Friend A</a> The ending songs were also really good, especially the 2nd ending.</p>

<p>I really loved the show after 3 episodes, and most of my backgrounds are Your Lie In April related now :). After 3 episodes in, I am obsessed with Kaori so much ‚Äì she‚Äôs so cute, talented, and wise for being just a 14 year old, yet at the same time, she still shows off her youthfulness. One of my absolute favourite things in Your Lie In April was the artwork ‚Äì it is absolutely stunning and it is by far my favourite artwork out of any anime I‚Äôve watched so far. Because of this show, I‚Äôve become more motivated overall, and also because of this show, I‚Äôve been considering learning how to sing, play guitar, and relearn piano (Which‚Äôll happen sometime in the near future :)).</p>

As with most of the fanbase, one thing I disliked was that the ending was quite obvious, but still, the ending made me cry. One thing I wished for is that Kaori and Arima had more than one performance (twice technically), because their performance together was such a legendary performance even with little to no practice together. I would've liked to see them perform together at full force, where they practice together and have chemistry together.

<p>This anime was also very different compared to the other anime I‚Äôve watched. I really loved the main 4 cast of characters ‚Äì Arima, Tsubaki, Watari, and Kaori, with all of them having good backstory and character development. I also loved the music (introduction, ending, and background music) so much in this anime, and how the main premise was centered around music (which is something I  have wanted to get into, but never have been motivated to get into). If I were to give it a grade, I would have to give this anime a 10/10. I understand that this anime has flaws within it, but I would have to give this anime a 10/10 mainly because it has helped me open my eyes to music again, and it has helped me with my real life ‚Äì  keeping me motivated and excited to practice how to sing, play guitar, and possibly relearn piano later.</p>
