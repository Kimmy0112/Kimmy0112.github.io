<p>Throughout high school and elementary school, I was a very quiet person overall â€“ not an interesting person to say the least. I did not have a lot of extracurriculars I participated in, I did not participate that much in class, I was near the bottom of the list of grades, etcâ€¦ Throughout my grade 11 and grade 12 year, I wanted to change something about my life because honestly, I wasnâ€™t really happy with how my life was going. I picked up some small hobbies like photography and a little bit of photography editing and video editing, and joined a multicultural dance club.</p>

<p>Now that high school is almost over, I have decided I want to change my life completely during University, and become happier and busier with my life. Why University? I think University is the perfect option to change my life completely because you have a lot of free time on your hands, or thatâ€™s what I think before going into University. Furthermore, I want to do something with that free time instead of sitting and watching Youtube all day. Since whenever I watch Youtube all day, I feel really bad about myself, always feel down and feeding negatively towards my mental health.</p>
