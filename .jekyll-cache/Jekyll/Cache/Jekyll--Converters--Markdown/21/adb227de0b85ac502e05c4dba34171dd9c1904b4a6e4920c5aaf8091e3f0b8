<p>Hello Everyone!<br />
My name is Ian, and I am an 18 year old who is attending Huron University at Western.</p>

<h3 id="passion-and-interests">Passion and Interests</h3>
<p>When I was growing up, I would always play basketball at school with my friends, and I would always play catch with my father. Reading is something I recently picked up a few years ago however, I do not read that often, but I am currently reading the Eragon series (Iâ€™m on the last book, Inheritance). Iâ€™ve always enjoyed walking through nature and appreciating nature whilst being alone, however my parents donâ€™t like me going out alone, especially during COVID, so I always have to go with a friend. As for photography, I started shooting roughly a year ago, and itâ€™s been a really fun hobby to pick up â€“ trying to find dull items and finding a way to turn them into an interesting photo. I just recently picked up working out a few weeks ago (as of June 6th, 2021). It is a fun hobby that challenges my mental and physical strength. Gaming has been with me all my life.</p>

<p>At a very young age, I started gaming. One of the first games I remember was Runescape and/or Club Penguin. However, nowadays and throughout my childhood, itâ€™s moreso Pokemon and Minecraft. A few months ago, peaking top 50 in Generation 7 Doubles OU on Pokemon Showdown. Later, picking up YuGioh (that I still play to this day). As of December 6th, 2020, I started playing League of Legends, which is a very fun (and tilting) MOBA game. As of May 2021, I recently picked up OSU which is a rhythm game where you C L I C K  T H E  C I R C L E S.</p>
