<p>Burger King was supposed to call me yesterday to tell me the time I will start and end my shift on June 29th. Yesterday, they didnâ€™t call, so I decided to call today, and they explained that my start date will be getting pushed back since my Burger King is changing from opening - 12am to 24 hours Burger King. So they told me that donâ€™t assume that I will work for another week so you donâ€™t have to adjust to a schedule for 1 week and go to a whole new schedule another week. The next date Burger King gave me was July 6th with an unknown start and end time. Not going to lie, I was really bummed out that I didnâ€™t work on the 29th since Iâ€™ve been really anxious and I donâ€™t really know what to expect and/or what they expect of me during my first day here.</p>

<p>I just got a call today that my shift is Wednesday, July 7th, so letâ€™s see how that goes. So far, Iâ€™ve been studying the notes that were provided online.</p>

<p>The day of the shift. 4 hours before the shift, I was really nervous. When I got to Burger King, the start of the shift started pretty chill, I learned how to cook whopper patties, burgers, and impossible whopper patties. The woman and her friend teaching me were really nice, and she talked about anime with me, and she recommended me to watch Full Metal Alchemist as my next anime. Afterwards, I learned how to make whoppers, impossible whoppers, and cheeseburgers. The chill vibe went on for about 3 hours. However, around 5pm, the dinner rush began to hit. I started getting huge orders: 7 whoppers, 3 whoppers, 2 bacon king. It made sense why so many whoppers were ordered since it was whopper wednesday. I tried to make these sandwiches as fast as possible, however I ultimately fell behind since there were so many whoppers being ordered, and I was not quick enough yet. Thankfully, all of my co-workers helped me since I got really behind on orders, and I am really thankful for that. As for cooking patties, we went through a whole bag full of whoppers and burgers during this time.  The dinner rush lasted until 5 minutes before my shift ended, so I got to relax a bit before I went home. Before leaving, my manager told me that this is the busiest she has ever seen, and on typical days I come in, it wonâ€™t be this busy. Once I got home, my legs felt like jelly, probably since I havenâ€™t stood for that long for a consistent amount of time. It was quite an experience, and I actually kind of enjoyed it when it was not a dinner rush, and Iâ€™m excited to see what the future holds for me at Burger King ^.^.</p>
