<p>After a hiatus of listening to Twice songs, I have been slowly getting back into Twice music, and kinda fan-boying for Twice again (not to the extent of last year, but still), so I wanted to make this list :p.</p>

<h4 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h4>
<p>Honourable mentions for this list are I Can‚Äôt Stop Me, Kura Kura, Swing, Chillax, Sunset, Polish, and After Moon.</p>

<h4 id="15---breakthrough">15 - Breakthrough</h4>
<p>At number 15, we have Breakthrough. In Breakthrough, the chorus, verse, and choreography are really addicting, but I think that the bridge is kind of lackluster. Furthermore, I liked that Momo and Sana got to use their real voice in this song, instead of their cutesy voices in most other Twice songs. I believe that Breakthrough (at the time) was one of Twice‚Äôs best visual eras, and probably one of my favourite visual eras overall of Twice. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="14---stay-by-my-side">14 - Stay By My Side</h4>
<p>At number 14, we have Stay By Me Side. Stay By My Side was an OST for a Japanese drama called Bad Love Picture: Book of Midnight. What I love about this song is that the vocals are really good, and the whole song is very relaxing and chill. I also love the intro part, where Momo and Jihyo sing the ‚ÄúHa ah Ha ah‚Äù part, since it sounds very elegant.<br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="13---the-best-thing-i-ever-did">13 - The Best Thing I Ever Did</h4>
<p>At number 13, we have The Best Thing I Ever did. I love this song, but the sad part is that not a lot of ONCE‚Äôs know this song, given the fact that the music video has less than 50 million views. One thing that I always loved about this song is that there are little video clips of every era up to that point in the video. This song is a very soothing song, and has a very relaxing vibe to it.<br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="12---fancy">12 - Fancy</h4>
<p>At number 12, we have Fancy. This is the song that got me into Twice initially. I found it through my recommended feed on Youtube. For those who are wondering, the first 2 people who caught my eye in the M/V were Mina and Momo. Fancy has a very addicting chorus and an easy to remember choreography. There‚Äôs not much to say about this song because the whole song just screams iconic. If you want to see a really good Fancy performance, you should watch the 2019 MAMA Fancy performance (Nayeon‚Äôs opening for that is so pretty). <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="11---yes-or-yes">11 - Yes or Yes</h4>
<p>At Number 11, we have Yes or Yes. Everything about this song is really addicting ‚Äì the choreography, the Minari intro, the upbeat and energetic song, the cutesy aspect to it, the backstory of the song, and how the song flows very well. Yes or Yes is probably one of my top 3 favourite choreographies from Twice. I don‚Äôt know why, but there was a moment when I was talking to my friend about an cool prom ask out ideas, and I was like:  ‚Äúwhat if a girl asked me out to prom, with this: Hey boy, I‚Äôm going to make this simple for you, you got 2 choices, Yes Or Yes‚Äù. It never happened btw :p. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="10----first-time">10 -  First Time</h4>
<p>At number 10, we have First Time. Just to note, Jihyo wrote this song, and the vocals are so good. I really loved the intro with the Mina + Tzuyu falsetto part and the chorus, both being really catchy. When Jihyo sings ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you, it gives me butterflies‚Äù during the chorus, it gives me chills since her falsetto is so beautiful. Also, the post chorus Chaeyoung falsettos were also beautiful. ‚ÄúStrawberry kisses taste so good to me‚Äù, I love how Mina is referencing Chaeyoung and Mina ship ‚Äì good one Jihyo. <br /><br /></p>
