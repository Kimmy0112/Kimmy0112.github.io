I"i	<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>Throughout high school and elementary school, I was a very quiet person overall – not an interesting person to say the least. I did not have a lot of extracurriculars I participated in, I did not participate that much in class, I was near the bottom of the list of grades, etc… Throughout my grade 11 and grade 12 year, I wanted to change something about my life because honestly, I wasn’t really happy with how my life was going. I picked up some small hobbies like photography and a little bit of photography editing and video editing, and joined a multicultural dance club.</p>

<p>Now that high school is almost over, I have decided I want to change my life completely during University, and become happier and busier with my life. Why University? I think University is the perfect option to change my life completely because you have a lot of free time on your hands, or that’s what I think before going into University. Furthermore, I want to do something with that free time instead of sitting and watching Youtube all day. Since whenever I watch Youtube all day, I feel really bad about myself, always feel down and feeding negatively towards my mental health.</p>

<p>Below are my 5 year goal plans for university:</p>

<h3 id="my-goals">My Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learn Korean</li>
  <li>Learn Guitar</li>
  <li>Relearn Piano (Digital Piano, when in apartment)</li>
  <li>Learn how to sing</li>
  <li>Get a Job</li>
  <li>Get Drivers License</li>

  <li>Learn more about computers</li>

  <li>In year 4, apply for an internship for my major</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not exactly sure why, but one thing that has been in my dreams and in daydreams is seeing my older self livestreaming on Youtube, doing this bi-monthly singing performance with my acoustic guitar or piano whilst singing a korean or english ballad. It would be kind of like a performance, I would like 5 or 6 songs and perform them to the audience.</p>
