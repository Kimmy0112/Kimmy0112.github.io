I"H<p>The following below are the animes, movies, and Tv Shows and kdramas I would want to watch sometime in the future. I just recently got into anime a few months ago, and I got into kdramas last year. However, I have only watch 1 KDrama due to the lengths of each episode, which is roughly an hour long. Also, I have only watched 1 Anime (Attack On Titan), and I believe that both shows were really great. However, I never thought about getting into more animes, kdramas, and Tv shows until now, so here is my list (They are in no particular order):</p>
