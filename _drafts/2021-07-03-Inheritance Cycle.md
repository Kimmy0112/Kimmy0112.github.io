-This review will contain spoilers 
-as a kid, i didnt really read a lot of books besides for random pokemon manga books, basketball books, and ones that I would have to read through school 
-as a kid, ive always enjoyed fantasy books and fantasy games. 
-I've tried a lot of books, and Eragon was one of the 2 (the other being harry potter) books I actually got hooked into. 
-However, it was a very daunting task since the first book had 504 pages, the 2nd book had 679 pages, the third book having 763 pages and the last book having 849 pages, this is a lot compared to a harry potter series
-Decided to do a summary of the whole plot instead of doing a review cause firstly, Eragon has been out since 2002, and secondly, I really enjoy the plot of the story, since it is really complicated and there is a lot of things to take into consideration, and I guess it's kind of like a treasure chest for me later if I want to remember what this series is about and why I loved it so much. 
-On july 4th 2021, ill be reading the final book of the inheritance series, which is called inheritance
