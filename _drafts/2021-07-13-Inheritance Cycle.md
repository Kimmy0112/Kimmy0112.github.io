### How did I get intrested in the Inheritence series? 
As a kid, I didn't really read a lot of books besides for Pokemon manga books, basketball books, and ones that I was forced to read in school (even then, I would occsaionally use sparknotes), and as a kid, I also really enjoyed fantasy games and youtube videos. Before Eragon, there wer a lot of other books that I tried out, but none of them seemed to hook me in like Eragon. Eragon was one of the 2 books I actually got hooked into (the other one being Harry Potter). I started reading Eragon, but it was a very daunting task since the first book having 504 pages, 2nd booking having 679 pages, third book having 763 pages, and the last book having 849 pages. Compared to the Pokemon manga books, basketball books, and the books I was forced to read in school, this was a lot of pages. After I read the ending of the first book, I was even more hooked then before, and started reading the next book, and the next, and now I am on the final book, Inheritence. <br> <br>

I decided to do a summary of the whole plot instead of doing a review cause first of all, Eragon has been out for 19 years, and secondly, it would be hrd doing a review since there are so many moving parts and lore in each book, and it would be hard to not spoil any of it. Also, I really enjoy the plot of the story since it is really complicated, and again, there a lot of moving parts. I guess this blog can be considered kind of like a treasure chest for me later if I want to remember what this series is about and why I loved it so much. 

### Eragon Summary 
The protagonist, Eragon goes out hunting to try and find food for his family, and he goes into the Spine, a forbidden area to go hunting in the books. While trying to hunt for his family, he finds a mysterious blue stone. Eragon's family has little to no money, lives on the outskirts of town, and winter is coming soon, so Eragon tries to sell the stone to the butcher, Sloan, but he denies it since it was from the forbidden Spine. The egg eventually hatches into a dragon called Saphira, and at that moment, Eragon realizes that dragons do exist in Alagaesia, and it is not just a myth. Eragon must keep the dragon a secret from everybody too. Eragon realizes that there is also a telepathic link between him and Saphira, and he is officially named a dragon rider. Eragon's cousin, Roran, is off to labour work because his future wife's, Katrina's, father (also known as the butcher, Sloan), would not allow them to marry because Roran did not have enough money, and frankly, Sloan hates Roran outright. Monsters called the Ra'zac come searching for the egg, and Eragon escapes on Saphira before the Ra'zac comes, leaving his uncle to be killed.

Brom, who is a story teller at Carvahall is his travelling companion, trying to track down the Ra'zac and kill them. Brom teaches Ergaon everything, and later tells Eragon that the leader of the empire, Galbatorix (someone who wants to rule all of Alagaesia) sent the Ra'zac to find the egg. There are 2 empires in Alagaesia, the Empire, which is ruled by Galbatorix, with humans and Urgals by his side, and the Varden, which are Dwarves, Eleves, and humans on their side. As Brom and Eragon are travelling, Brom teaches Eragon everything -- teaching him how to use a sword, defeat he Ra'zac, teach him how to read, the ancient lanaguage of the eleves, and some things to know being a dragon rider. Eragon and Brom arrive in Terim to track down the Ra'zac, but they were too late, so they continue to Dras-Leona, but they were ambushed by the Ra'zac
