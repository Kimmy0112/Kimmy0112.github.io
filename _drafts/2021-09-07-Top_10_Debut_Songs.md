### 6 - Energetic - WANNA ONE
At number 6, we have Energetic by Wanna One. 

### 5 - I - TAEYEON
At number 5 we have I by Taeyeon. It has a really catchy prechorus, bridge, and verse -- showing off Taeyeon's vocal capabilities really effectively. I really like the prechorus and the bridge of this song because her vocals are so damn beautiful then.  I really like the style of the MV -- very naturistic, giving me roadtrip vibes -- because the scenes she used in her MV are photos I would take. No only does the background look beautiful, but Taeyeon herself -- she looks very young and pretty. However, though the chorus is very repetitive, I can never get enough of her vocals in the chorus -- very very beautiful -- but still repetitive. With this in mind, I have I by Taeyeon at number 5.

### 4 - Latata - (G)I-DLE
At number 4, we have Latata by (G)I-dle. Let me preface this beforehand: Soyeon is an absolute lyrical and musical genius. Latata has a very good intro, a very addicting chorus, a very captivating bridge, very simple, yets stunning outfits, and it shows off (G)I-dle's insane visuals (personally, they are my favourite visual group including Soojin!!). Just like in every (G)I-dle song, Yuqi's deep voice is so damn attractive and addicting -- perfectly showing within this song. One thing I love is that compared to other kpop groups, the MV scenes, style, and concept seems different -- as if they are creating their own style. However, though the prechorus was decent at most, and the song kind of felt predicatable -- which is why I have Latata at number 4.

### 3 - Crown - TXT 
At number 3, we have Crown by TXT. Crown has a very catchy prechorus a very addicting chorus alongside intresting group dance choreographies within the chorus. This is one of my favourite choegraphies of the song, however one this that i dislike about the choreography was the dab as it seemed kind of cringey. One of my favourite parts of the MV was that there were cute animation edits, which is a great way to show off their youthfullness (as well as dabbing, but still, I personally don't really like it). However, one thing that is keeping this song at number 3 is that I didn't really like the bridge too much -- it wasn't really a intresting bridge. Furthermore, I feel like the bridge of this song is extra short compared to the other songs on this list. With all these reasons in mind, Crown by TXT is at number 2.   

### 2 - Whistle - BLACKPINK 
At number 2, we have Whistle by Blackink. This is a very unique and different kpop song -- which is why I love it so much. Whistle has a really good hook with the intro, a very addicting prechorus, chorus, bridge, and a very catching MV. Within the song, there was a great contrast between rapping with Jennie and Lisa and vocals with Jisoo and Rose. Furthermore, the MV represented each idol very well with Lisa and Jennie having more swaggy/bad boy-like scenes and Jisoo and Rose having more girl crush-like scenes -- perfectly showing off the "Black" and "Pink" part of Blackpink. However, with all this in mind, I didn't really like the choeography too much, which in my opinion, Whistle by Blackpink is at number 2. 

### 1 - La Vie En Rose - IZ*ONE
At number 1, we have La Vie En Rose by IZ*ONE. This song is just outright addicting -- with the beautiful MV, amazing visuals in he MV, the amazing outfits, and amazing chooeography. The pre-chorus of this song is out of this world, and the chorus of this song is, as always, very catchy. However, just like most songs, the bridge is the decideing factor between if i like a song and love a song. Let me tell you, the bridge of this song never fails to disastify me. Througout the whole song, there is not one part of the song that feels out of place, nor is there one part of the song that is forgetful to me -- which is why I love this song even more. Personally, I do not think there will be any debut song that will top this one for me (Try me :p).
