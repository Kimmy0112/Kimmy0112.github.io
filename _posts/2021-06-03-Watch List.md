The following below are the animes, movies, and Tv Shows and kdramas I would want to watch sometime in the future. I just recently got into anime a few months ago, and I got into kdramas last year. However, I have only watch 1 KDrama due to the lengths of each episode, which is roughly an hour long. Also, I have only watched 1 Anime (Attack On Titan), and I believe that both shows were really great. However, I never thought about getting into more animes, kdramas, and Tv shows until now, so here is my list (They are in no particular order):

# Animes 
* Seraph Of The End  
* Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood   
* Code Geass  
* No game No life  
* <s> Promised Neverland </s> 
* Jujutsu Kaisen  
* <s>Your Lie in April </s> 
* Yi Gi Oh  
* Naruto   
* Tower of God
* Violet Evergarden   

# KDrama 
* True Beauty  
* Itaewon Class  
* Crash Landing on You   

# Movies 
* Weather With You  
* Your Name
