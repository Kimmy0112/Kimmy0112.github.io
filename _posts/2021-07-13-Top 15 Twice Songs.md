### Why Did I Make This?  
After a hiatus of listening to Twice songs, I have been slowly getting back into Twice music, and kinda fan-boying for Twice again (not to the extent of last year, but still), so I wanted to make this list :p. 
 
#### Honourable Mentions
Honourable mentions for this list are I Can't Stop Me, Kura Kura, Swing, Chillax, Sunset, Polish, and After Moon.  
 
#### 15 - Breakthrough
At number 15, we have Breakthrough. In Breakthrough, the chorus, verse, and choreography are really addicting, but I think that the bridge is kind of lackluster. Furthermore, I liked that Momo and Sana got to use their real voice in this song, instead of their cutesy voices in most other Twice songs. I believe that Breakthrough (at the time) was one of Twice's best visual eras, and probably one of my favourite visual eras overall of Twice. <br><br>

#### 14 - Stay By My Side
At number 14, we have Stay By Me Side. Stay By My Side was an OST for a Japanese drama called Bad Love Picture: Book of Midnight. What I love about this song is that the vocals are really good, and the whole song is very relaxing and chill. I also love the intro part, where Momo and Jihyo sing the "Ha ah Ha ah" part, since it sounds very elegant.<br><br>

#### 13 - The Best Thing I Ever Did
At number 13, we have The Best Thing I Ever did. I love this song, but the sad part is that not a lot of ONCE's know this song, given the fact that the music video has less than 50 million views. One thing that I always loved about this song is that there are little video clips of every era up to that point in the video. This song is a very soothing song, and has a very relaxing vibe to it.<br><br>

#### 12 - Fancy
At number 12, we have Fancy. This is the song that got me into Twice initially. I found it through my recommended feed on Youtube. For those who are wondering, the first 2 people who caught my eye in the M/V were Mina and Momo. Fancy has a very addicting chorus and an easy to remember choreography. There's not much to say about this song because the whole song just screams iconic. If you want to see a really good Fancy performance, you should watch the 2019 MAMA Fancy performance (Nayeon's opening for that is so pretty). <br><br>

#### 11 - Yes or Yes
At Number 11, we have Yes or Yes. Everything about this song is really addicting -- the choreography, the Minari intro, the upbeat and energetic song, the cutesy aspect to it, the backstory of the song, and how the song flows very well. Yes or Yes is probably one of my top 3 favourite choreographies from Twice. I don't know why, but there was a moment when I was talking to my friend about an cool prom ask out ideas, and I was like:  "what if a girl asked me out to prom, with this: Hey boy, I'm going to make this simple for you, you got 2 choices, Yes Or Yes". It never happened btw :p. <br><br>

#### 10 -  First Time 
At number 10, we have First Time. Just to note, Jihyo wrote this song, and the vocals are so good. I really loved the intro with the Mina + Tzuyu falsetto part and the chorus, both being really catchy. When Jihyo sings "I don't know about you, it gives me butterflies" during the chorus, it gives me chills since her falsetto is so beautiful. Also, the post chorus Chaeyoung falsettos were also beautiful. "Strawberry kisses taste so good to me", I love how Mina is referencing Chaeyoung and Mina ship -- good one Jihyo. <br><br>

#### 9 - Oxygen
At number 9, we have Oxygen. The song is overall addicting, especially the build up to the chorus. The vocals of this song are so beautiful, giving off very chill and relaxing vibes. I love Mina + Nayeon intro in this song so much. There was also one moment where there were more Mina falsetto aside from the intro which were super duper addicting. <br><br>

#### 8 - Feel Special 
At number 8, we have Feel Special. This was the first song that was released when I was officially a Once. The vocals in this song are really good, the M/V looks really good, and the choreography is really good as well. In the M/V, I love Minari's part, and I love this era overall. I love this song even more because Twice dedicated this song to Minari because of the hiatus Minari had to go through. I'm glad Minari is back better than ever too! This song literally got me obsessed with Twice -- figuring out all the performance dates, release dates, and whatnot. Furthermore, I have a Feel Special album, which was my very first kpop album (thanks dad!). I recommend you listen to the R&B Feel Special performance since it was really really good (I cried whilst watching the Minari intro, it was very emotional :( ). <br><br>

#### 7 - Depend On You
At number 7, we got Depend on You. Nayeon wrote this song, and I'm 99% sure this song was for Minari since the meaning of the song is about Minari's hiatus during the Feel Special era. I love the vocals of everyone in this song too -- Can't believe that Nayeonie made this masterpiece of a song. You should watch the Depend On You performance video because their vocals and visuals are insane.

#### 6 - One In A Million 
At number 6, we have One In A Million. For the longest time, this was my #1 favourite song,. It's a very meaningful song and makes me want to cry everytime -- making for a great Twice anthem song. I know that everybody talks about it, but that Jeongyeon high note, hello? Jeongyeon more lines please. This is the song that has made me love Nayeon so much. There is one performance in particular, and though it may seem very miniscule, I thought it was a big deal and very very cute of Nayeonie. I've seen many comments like "final Twice concert, final Twice song... One In A Million, singing their heart out to Onces", and if Twice does disband (and I know that they will eventually -- all good things

#### 5 - Stuck 
At number 5, we have Stuck. For this song, I've heard a lot of comparisons to Heart Shaker and What Is Love vibes, and I can very well hear it. This song is a very beautiful song, with a very catchy chorus, and a very very great slow build up into the bridge and chorus of the song. The vocals are really really good, Mina's deep vocals and Jeongyeon's pre chorus vocals standing out to me the most. This song feels like I am trying to confess to someone, even though I don't like anyone. <br><br>

#### 4 - Ice Cream/Melting 
At number 4, we have Ice Cream or Melting. This was originally my 2nd favourite song. The vocals are so good, especially the really addicting Nayeon falsetto in the chorus. the chorus of this song is very very catchy, it's like *ice cream that melts me*. I read somewhere that this song really sounds like an OST, and I second that statement. I love the background vocals during the 3rd chorus section too. Everything about this song is very beautiful. I loved seeing Minari sing this song on her birthday on her VLive, and listening to Minari sing to Nayeon's falsetto was very very beautiful.

#### 3 - Perfect World
At number 3, we have Perfect World. It's been roughly 2 weeks since this song's release and this song is already climbing really quick on the favourite Twice song ladder. The whole song is super duper addicting, with great vocals, especially the verse and the chorus of the song with Jihyo's vocals, which were absolutely beautiful. I also liked the Minari pre chorus and rap part. The only thing I dislike, which isn't too much of a deal anyways, is that Momo only has english lines in a Japanese song (She is Japanese).  Seeing the live performance was very beautiful too -- seeing Jihyo absolutely dominating the stage. Due to this song being very addicting, this song has potential on climbing the list even more.

#### 2 - Be As One 
At number 2, we got Be As One by Twice. It's a very sad, emotional, and meaningful song. I love the overall vibe of this song, and I would listen to it whenever I feel sad or alone. The whole song just screams perfection in my ears everytime I listen to it. There are 3 versions to this song: Korean, Japanese, and Acapella. Each version of the song has a unique little touch to it that makes me love all 3 of the versions. However, one thing that remains consistent in all 3 of the songs are the beautiful vocals Twice has gifted us with this song -- especially the Jihyo + Mina vocal part. this is the type of song I would sing to if someone loved me back :>, but 2 problems with that, I can't sing, and no one loves me :>.

#### 1 - Cry For Me 
At the number 1 spot, we have Cry For Me. Everything in the song is done really really good -- the great choreography for both Cry For Me version 1 and 2, the great vocals by everyone, everyone's visuals (literally like all eras), everything. I meant everything. One of my favourite parts of the song is the intro part and post chorus part with Sana. I've also been spamming this song a lot on OSU, since it is a very addicting song. Ever since Cry For Me's release, I've been fully obsessed with this song -- with every part of the song being perfect. There is no weak part of the song in Cry for Me, and each part of the song flows very well into one another. If you want a very beautiful performance of this song, go watch the Cry For Me MAMA 2020.

Just to note, in my opinion, number 1 and number 2 can literally be interchangeable.
