#### Economics 
Ah, my first ever university class. Honestly, the class was really chill, mainly due to the professor. The class was supposed to go on for 2 hours but it ended up lasting for 20 minutes. All we did in those 20 minutes was review the course outline and ask any questions regarding the course. One thing I learned about the economics class was that though our mark is dependent on 2 midterms and a final, all the midterms and finals are multiple choice. I already had the previous edition of the book, due to my brother taking this course, so after class, I asked my professor whether or not he recommends me getting another textbook and spending another 200 dollars. He told me it was nope -- so happy Ian, saving 200 dollars.

#### Globalization 
The teacher in globalization was really nice, and honestly one of my favourite. The teacher was really funny, telling us a lot of jokes and interesting stories about her life to the class -- even listening to 2 of her 'Ted Talks'. One about how her dog's name was named and how university textbooks are a scam. Furthermore, she interacted with all of the students in our class very well -- letting some students add little comments and jokes during her stories. Whilst reading the syllabus a few days prior to class, one thing that worried me was the 10% class participation because I get lots of anxiety when it comes to class participation and when I have to talk in front of the class, I feel as though I cannot articulate myself properly. However, thankfully, she told the class if anyone has any anxiety regarding class participation to come and talk to her and she'll figure out a way to make up the 10% class participation grade. So, after class, I did exactly that. I talked to her about how I get very anxious when it comes to class participation, and she figured out a different way to make up the 10% of the class participation mark -- how very sweet of her. Furthermore, the teacher and I bonded really well too -- after class, her and I talked about my hobbies and university plans. 
 
 
#### Computer Science
This was my first main campus class, and to say the least, the lecture rooms were about 4 or 5 times larger than Huron's lecture rooms. In this one computer science class, I would say there were around 200-250 students in one auditorium room compared to around 40-50 at Huron. In this class, it was hard to understand the instructor half of the time because his microphone was really quiet, and not trying to be rude, but he had a heavy accent as well. Also, I'm not sure why, but during the whole lecture, there was a girl near me who kept looking at me. 
 
### Day 3 - Monday

### Economics 
This was a first time experience. There was no economics class today because our professor had a doctor's appointment at the specific time the lecture started, so class got cancelled :). 
 

### Computer Science - Lab
There is no computer science lab this week because the labs start on the 3rd week of school 
 
### Calculus Tutorial
This was my first tutorial on the main campus, mainly due to the class being asynchronous. There were quite a lot of people in our calculus tutorial class -- the whole room got filled. Our instructor for the tutorial seemed relatively old, and it was kind of hard to understand the TA most of the time because his instructions were unclear. It wasn't really an eventful class to be honest other than 2 students just leaving in the middle of the class... I guess that's somewhat interesting right? 
 
### Day 4 - Tuesday

### Globalization
This wasn't really an eventful class either. She did the attendance out loud in a lecture, being really nice and welcoming to everyone. We went to go watch a very racist movie about Mexicans, and she even allowed us to take a 10 minute break before watching the documentary. The outdoors near our classroom is pretty refreshing with one of the many entrances to the Medway Heritage Forest entrance being right there.
 
### Computer Science 
Computer science is a very chill class, and we got to learn about basic programming stuff. Nothing that interesting happened in this class to be honest. 
 
### Business Administration 
It's been around 5 minutes in this class, and there already was a girl who kept looking at me. The professor was 30 minutes late, but he said nothing regarding why he was late (he just started the lecture like it was a normal Tuesday). There was nothing eventful that went on in the class other than this class is 3 HOURS LONG. 
 
### Day 5 - Wednesday

### Economics
I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, and the room was freezing. The girl was staring at me again, but I couldn't care less because I was mainly thinking about how I'm going to survive 2 hours in this freezing cold room. It was roughly like 5-10 degrees in there I promise. We went over grade 9 mathematics for like 30 minutes, talking about how to calculate slope and how to calculate a graph using y=mx+b and the slope formula.
